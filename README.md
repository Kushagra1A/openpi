# 🤖 openpi - Easy Models for Robotics

Welcome to openpi! Here, you will find open-source models to enhance your robotics projects.

## 📦 Overview

openpi offers three types of models, developed by the Physical Intelligence team:

- **π₀ model**: A vision-language-action model that helps robots interpret and act on visual data.
- **π₀-FAST model**: An autoregressive version of the π₀ model, utilizing the FAST action tokenizer for quicker responses.
- **π₀.₅ model**: An upgraded version of π₀, designed for better generalization in open-world environments through knowledge insulation.

All models include base checkpoints, pre-trained on thousands of hours of robot data, along with examples to help you use them directly or adapt them for your needs.
