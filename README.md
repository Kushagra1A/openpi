# ü§ñ openpi - Easy Models for Robotics

Welcome to openpi! Here, you will find open-source models to enhance your robotics projects.

## üì¶ Overview

openpi offers three types of models, developed by the Physical Intelligence team:

- **œÄ‚ÇÄ model**: A vision-language-action model that helps robots interpret and act on visual data.
- **œÄ‚ÇÄ-FAST model**: An autoregressive version of the œÄ‚ÇÄ model, utilizing the FAST action tokenizer for quicker responses.
- **œÄ‚ÇÄ.‚ÇÖ model**: An upgraded version of œÄ‚ÇÄ, designed for better generalization in open-world environments through knowledge insulation.

All models include base checkpoints, pre-trained on thousands of hours of robot data, along with examples to help you use them directly or adapt them for your needs.
